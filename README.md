Origami Object Detection using YOLOv5

I am testing my knowledge in object detection field by using YOLOv5 and custom dataset.

The dataset i have made from scratch. Taking pictures for objects then labeling them on roboflow website.

The most benefit from this experience is that i got a lot of questions that i need their answers, most of them i could not find their answers by easy searching.

I will list all questions i have until now to find their answers later. The question that i will find it's answer and sure about it by 90%-98%, i will write down it's answer.
